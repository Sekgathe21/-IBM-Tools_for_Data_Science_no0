# Explanation of Code

## Objectives

The code aims to provide a summary of Data Science tools and ecosystem. It lists popular languages, commonly used libraries, and demonstrates simple arithmetic operations.

## Popular Languages for Data Science

The code lists several popular programming languages used in Data Science, including Python, SQL, R, Java, C++, Scala, and Julia.

## Commonly Used Libraries

It identifies commonly used libraries in Data Science such as NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Scikit-learn, Keras, and TensorFlow.

## Data Science Tools

The code also mentions common tools utilized in Data Science, including Jupyter, RStudio, and Spyder.

## Examples of Arithmetic Expressions in Python

The code demonstrates evaluation of arithmetic expressions in Python. It showcases a simple expression to multiply and add integers, followed by a conversion of minutes to hours.

```python
# This is a simple arithmetic expression to multiply then add integers
result = (3 * 4) + 5
print(result)  # Output: 17

# This will convert 200 minutes to hours by dividing by 60
minutes = 200
conversion_to_hours = minutes / 60
print(f"{conversion_to_hours} hours")  # Output: 3.3333333333333335 hours
